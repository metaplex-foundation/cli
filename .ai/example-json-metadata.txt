There are 5 types of NFT category
- image
- audio
- video
- html
- vr

Image
When an image NFT is created only the `image` field needs to populated with the image uri.
The image uri is also placed in the `properties:files` array at index 0. 

Audio, Video, HTML, VR
When another `category` type is selected then an image uri is still required in the `image` field. This is used as a placeholder for the NFT.
The selected category type is then uploaded and placed in the `animation_url` field.
The animation_uri is also placed in the `properties:files` array at index 1.

The `category` should then be set to the selected lower case value.

The supported file types should be

image - .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
audio - .mp3, .wav
video - .mp4, .m4v
html - .html
vr - .glb
